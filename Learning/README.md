Introduction
============

This is a simple repository with a bunch of PHP training examples. It mainly focuses on a progression through Object-Orientated PHP.

## Part 1

*Difficulty: Basic*

This first exercise deals with creating a simple object that represents a car.

## Part 2

*Difficulty: Basic*

This exercise creates an object that represents an engine and then creates a car object with the engine attached.

We'll also go through validating the engine's fuel type and handling errors correctly.

## Part 3

*Difficulty: Intermediate*

In part 3 we expand to to be able to create and list multiple owners of the car whilst validating their date of birth.

## Part 4

*Difficulty: Intermediate*

In this part we create two cars that actually have the same engine. Then we apply them to a garage object.

## Part 5

*Difficulty: Advanced*

Now we'll explore how using objects is super useful.
