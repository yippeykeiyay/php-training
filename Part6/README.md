Part 6
===========

This part is actually a test! I need you to create a Pond that contains one or more Frogs.

The Pond has a fixed size of 12.

Frogs can vary in size from 1 to 5.

I expect to be able to write a programmatic script that enables me to create a Pond, then add multiple Frogs to it. The Pond needs to error when it is full, or cannot fit another Frog in it.

For example; the Pond might have a size of 12 and I have added 2 Frogs of size 4. The Pond should error if I add a bigger Frog that is size 6.
