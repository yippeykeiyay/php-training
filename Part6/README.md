Part 6
===========

This part is actually a test! I need you to create a Pond that can have Frogs added and removed from it.

The Pond has a fixed size of 12.

Frogs can vary in size from 1 to 5.

I expect to be able to write a script that enables me to create a Pond, then add or remove multiple Frogs to it. 

The Pond needs to error gracefully when it is full, or cannot fit another Frog in it.

For example; if I create the Pond and add two Frogs of size 4, I should not be able to add a third, larger Frog of size 5.
