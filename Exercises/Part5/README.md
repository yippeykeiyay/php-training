Part 5
===========

This part is one for you to do!

I need you create two classes; a Rock Pool and a Starfish.

The Starfish must have 2 settable attributes; a name and an age.

The Rock Pool can hold many Starfish so needs an array (list) to hold them, a fixed maximum size and a method to add Starfish to the array.

The Rock Pool's 'add' method must validate that the maximum size is not exceeded before the Starfish is added to the array.


### Bonus Points

  1) Correct type casting
  2) Exception throwing on validation
  3) Exception handling
