Part 4
===========

This part uses everything you've learned so far!

I want to create two classes; one to represent a Library and another to represent a Book.

The Book must have 4 settable attributes; a unique identifier (ID), title, author's name and number of pages.

The Library can hold many Books so must have a fixed size limit and a way to add Books to it.

The Library's list of Books must be private and the class must have a 'getter' function to return the Books.

The number of Books must not exceed the Library's fixed size.
