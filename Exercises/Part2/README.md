Part 2
===========

This part requires you to create a class to represent a Frog.

It should enable someone to create a Frog with two settable attributes; a name and a colour.

The class should have two 'getter' functions; one to get the Frog's name and the other to get the Frog's colour.

###Â Bonus Points
  1. Use the correct type casts for the name and size and return types for their getter functions
